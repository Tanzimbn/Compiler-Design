## Lexemes
A lexeme is a sequence of characters of a program that is grouped together as a single unit. When a compiler or interpreter reads the source code of a program, the compiler breaks it down into smaller units called lexemes. These lexemes will help the compiler to analyze and process the program efficiently.
### Example
#### Input
int main () {
    int a , b , c ;
    a = 10 ;
    b = 9 ;
    c = a + b ;

    return 0 ;
}
#### Output
int
main
()
{
int
a
,
b
,
c
;
a
=
10
;
b
=
9
;
c
=
a
+
b
;
return
0
;
}

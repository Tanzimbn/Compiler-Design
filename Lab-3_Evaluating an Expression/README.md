# Evaluating an expression
In compiler design, expression evaluation refers to the process of computing the result of an arithmetic or logical expression. This is done during the semantic analysis or code generation phase of a compiler.
### Output (with MOD)
```c++
(122+3)/(15-5)
(125)/(15-5)
125/(10)
12
```

### Output (without MOD)
```c++
(122+3)/(15-5)
(125)/(15-5)
125.00/(10)
12.5
```
